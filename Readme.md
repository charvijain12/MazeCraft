# MazeSolver

MazeSolver is a Python program that finds a path through a maze. It uses an input image of the maze and outputs a `.gif` file showing the solution path.



## Getting Started
To run the program, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. You can then run the program by executing the following command:

```bash
python maze_solver.py
```

Make sure the input maze image is located in the `./inputs/` directory. The maze should start from the top left and end at the bottom right.

You can generate a maze using this online maze generator.

The output `.gif` file will be saved in the `./outputs/` directory.



## Limitations
The input image of the maze should be in the `./inputs/` directory and follow the above-mentioned limitations.
The program is limited to finding solutions for mazes that start from the top left and end at the bottom right.
