# MazeCraft: Algorithmic Pathfinding 

MazeCraft is a Python program that specializes in finding a path through a maze. It takes an input image of the maze and generates a `.gif` file that vividly illustrates the solution path.

## Getting Started 

To run the program, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the program by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python maze_solver.py
   ```

4. Ensure that the input maze image is located in the `./inputs/` directory. The maze should have a starting point in the top left corner and an endpoint in the bottom right corner.

5. You can generate a maze using an online maze generator.

6. The output `.gif` file will be saved in the `./outputs/` directory.

## Limitations 

MazeMaestro has a few limitations to be aware of:

- The input image of the maze should be placed in the `./inputs/` directory and should adhere to the specified limitations.

- The program is designed for solving mazes that start from the top left corner and end at the bottom right corner.
